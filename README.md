# üëÅ Tracking Eye üëÅ

An interactive login form with a unique tracking eye animation effect. This project features a password input field with a "tracking eye" that responds to user interactions. The eye follows the cursor as the user focuses on the password input field. It's a fun and creative way to engage users during the login process.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Eye Animation**: The "eye" icon follows the user's cursor when hovering over the password field.
- **Responsive Login Form**: Simple and clean design for login with username and password fields.
- **Eye Button**: The button that contains the eye icon triggers a smooth animation for the password input.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Custom CSS** for styling and animations.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity and controlling the eye animation behavior.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd tracking-eye
```

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the page.

## Usage

- The webpage contains a login form where the "eye" follows your cursor when hovering over the password field.

- The eye effect is controlled by the script.js file, where the mouse movements are tracked to move the eye.
